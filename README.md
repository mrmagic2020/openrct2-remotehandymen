## Feature
- Handymen don't have to walk over litter to clean them - as long as the litter is within their patrol area, it will be automatically removed every day.
- Each handyman has a daily remote clean limit - set to 5 as default.
- You can conveniently supervise your handymen via a viewport. 
- You can synchronize / update local configuration to global configuration. Global configuration will be applied to new scenarios. 
- Global configuration can be restored.
